#Week 3 HTML/CSS assignment

In this folder you will find the source code for Berkshire Hathaway. For this challenge you will manipulate the html by following the User stories below.

Getting Started:
- Create a github repo and call it berkshire-site
- Open this folder using visual studio code.
- initialize git in this project and follow the instructions on the repo to set it up to this folder.
- open the index.html file to see it in the chrome browser

User Stories: (Remember to commit often using github)
- Change the title and header of the website to your name
- Change all instances of Berkshire hathaway to your name
- Change the color of your name to another color other than blue
- Remove the bullets from the <li>
- Remove the underline from the <a> links
- Change the font of the entire website
- Use your responsive web design skills. When the screen size is a mobile phone make sure the two columns stack and create one column. When when the screen size gets bigger it should be two columns which is what it is now.
- In the html file you will find a section that says "ADD YOUR CODE HERE" - Inside add the following:
- add 3 Li and make it horizontal
- Inside each li add a div that has an image tag which holds one cat image
- the cat images are different sizes keep the width of the images the same. (Never change the height of an image)
- Make sure that on mobile screens the 3 columns stack and expand when they are in a computer screen

When you complete the challenge push the changes to github. 
Copy the github link and post you link on the phase-0 channel or in the show-and-tell channel in discord. Ask the community for feedback and someone from the team will get back to you.

Try to follow github patterns. By creating a branch after your initial commit. Creating a pull request and merging your changes to master.
